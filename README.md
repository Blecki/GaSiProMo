Hello and welcome to gasipromo. Gasipromo happens to correpsond to nanowrimo, and, I suspect, be somewhat inspired by it. It's been a number of years since I've participated in nanowrimo, and I've decided to combine them. How do I complete a side project and write a novel? Why, Interactive Fiction, of course!

I will be writing a piece of interactive fiction using an authoring system I wrote last year. This is the one https://github.com/Blecki/RMUD . 

For a quick look at how it works, check out https://github.com/Blecki/RMUD/tree/master/SinglePlayer - this is the infamouse Cloak of Darkness game every IF authoring system is required by the laws of the universe to implement. If you happen to be familiar with Inform7, you'll notice the Inform7 source scattered throughout in the comments.

I'm not sure just yet what the game will be about. I have a couple ideas, but I've always found thinking up puzzles to be a bit challenging, and IF aint anything without good puzzles. I've just read The Martian so it will probably be hard science fiction. Unless it's not.
